Notes 5/3

- achieved accuracy of .78 on CV data. Largest sources of confusion seem to be Bombus/Xylocopa (understandable, not too much of a worry), Vespula/Dolichovespula (again, they're both basically yellowjackets for our purposes), and Sphecidae/Polistes (problematic).
- to improve accuracy and utility of model, I am going to reduce the number of classes. Dolichovespula and vespula can be safely merged. Pompilidae is adding noise for not much signal: these wasps are not common in the area I'm targeting and don't show up often on reddit. 
- this leaves us with 9 classes. I'm still worried about the Sphecidae/Polistes mixups: might need to search out more data for these classes.
- ideas for better distinguishing Bombus and Xylocopa? These are both basically big fuzzy doofuses, some confusion might be unavoidable. Maybe adjust output of model to display top two probabilities.
- do we need separate Vespa/Vespula classes? Would be nice to say "hornet" or "yellowjacket", but the social outcome is likely the same for these two classes.
- radical idea: three classes. "Friend Bee", "Friend Wasp", "Spicy" (and maybe "Other"/"Not a bee or wasp"). Stick Apis, Bombus, Xylocopa, Sphecidae, Scoliidae in "Friend", Vespula, Vespa, Polistes in "Spicy", and everything else in other. Looks like accuracy would be quite high. Obviously this decreases the utility of the model, but think about outcomes: if our purpose is to intervene quickly on these threads before people kill a thing, this at least gives them a lead and makes them think twice (and might encourage another friendly redditor to step in and clarify more quickly). 


You've found a friendly bee! My best guess is that this is Apis (honeybee)/Bombus (bumblebee)/Xylocopa (carpenter bee), but I'm known to make mistakes, and it might be (other classes). These bees are lynchpins of your backyard ecosystem: without them, flowers don't spread and vegetables don't grow. Maintaining a healthy backyard ecosystem by preserving these species helps encourage the growth of beautiful native plants, preserves local wildlife, and can be a (small, but significant!) way of combatting the negative impacts of climate change.

You've found a friendly wasp! (Yes, there is such a thing.) My best guess is that this is Sphecidae (thread-waisted wasp)/Scoliidae (scoliid wasp), though I'm known to make mistakes, and it might be (other classes). Like bees, these wasp species are important pollinators. What's more, they are typically solitary (no big nests to worry about) and rarely, if ever, sting humans (certain male members of the genus Sphex don't even have stingers!).  They also contribute to the health of your backyard ecosystem by preying on other arthopods, like spiders, centipedes, and the occasional tick. Needless to say, they're good friends to have around! Maintaining a healthy backyard ecosystem by preserving these species helps encourage the growth of beautiful native plants, preserves local wildlife, and can be a (small, but significant!) way of combatting the negative impacts of climate change on local biodiversity.

You've found a spicy friend -- exercise caution! My best guess is that this is Dolichovespula/Vespula (yellowjackets)/Vespa (hornets)/Polistes (paper wasps), though I'm known to make mistakes, and it might be (other classes). These species are defensive and sting, and usually form large communities with like-minded fellows. That being said, if possible, try to give them their space! They are an important part of the backyard ecosystem (as pollinators, predators, and prey) and are generally happy to mind their own business -- as long as you give them some head room. 


Note: I am a bot. I use machine learning to classify images of bees and wasps in order to promote conservation, coexistence, and thriving local ecosystems. Did I get this one wrong, or do you have other comments? Please [let me know]. If you'd like to use my model directly, you can try it out [here].
